# nodetuts

This is me following through most of SAMS' Teach Yourself node.js in 24 hours.
I skipped the install bits because I already have node v 0.10.24 on my laptop.

Feel free to borrow this: ISBN 0672335956 or 006.76 [COM] from [NLB][pl], then
work through it as I did. I will keep them in `/chapter/exercise/` order, with
some notes added on to the individual exercises.

# Legal stuff?

To be honest, I have not yet checked if this is entirely OK, but I guess it is
since the code is available [elsewhere on github][gh] anyway. I will put it up
on my own repository, so feel free to fork that too. :)
